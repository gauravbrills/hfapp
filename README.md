# ionic app with visualization in d3
This is an attempt to create an ionic app with some funky visualizations in d3.js and high charts.The backend is using elasticsearch and may
be dependant on the model .

This currently uses ionic with ng 1 . Will need to spend time to migrate this to ng 2 and ionic 2.
